Eventually, Henry's family is convinced that he should be placed in an institution. Henry's sudden disappearance from Verlin's world drives him deeper into himself. It's 1935 in rural Opeongo County, Ontario. Henry, who still lives with his parents, is a hulking man, which belies his slow mental status more closely resembling that of a child in many respects. Although many in the county view Henry as harmless, those who not support that view look to his association with such people as Elvin, who believes angels live behind his eyes, and one-legged Mabel, who lives by her own code, as confirmation that he is a menace. Nine year old Verlin is Henry's nephew, the son of Henry's brother Ferris and Ferris' wife Minnie. Verlin does not speak nor does he seem responsive to human stimuli, something that only occurred as he came out of infancy. It isn't until Henry starts spending time with Verlin that Verlin seems to become happy and respond to a human around him. However, Minnie wants to believe that response is for her. She also does not not trust Henry who increasingly takes off with Verlin on their adventures without asking either her or Ferris. As such, Minnie, like many in the county, want to see Henry institutionalized as she fears he could be a danger to Verlin. Caught in the middle is Ferris, who, like his and Henry's parents, loves and inherently trust him, but who wants to ensure Verlin's safety and happiness and wants to retain a supportive marriage with Minnie.\n",

However, austerity policies keep on dividing the continent into winners and loosers, creating great amount of suffering, particularly in so-called crisis countries. Consequently, the whole European project has become in doubt. PIIGS is a Southern European take into austerity dogma and states with the voice of prestigious international economists, intellectuals and experts, that the origin of the European debt crisis is not the inadequacy of people in crisis countries but the very foundation of euro itself. Unfortunately people are not immune to bad decision making, and the documentary shows how austerity turns into practice in Rome, focusing on a survival story of a cooperative assisting disabled people.\n",

            "ID: 136, TITLE: Flintown Kids (2005), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The town of Flint, Michigan, a miniscule point on the map, recently drew national attention through documentary film maker Michael Moore. Moore, a Flint native, wrote and directed the documentary Roger and Me about the darker side of capitalism and General Motors. Omar McGee, another Flint native, picks up where Moore left off with Flint Town Kids, a documentary showing the African American dark side of Flint. Flint is predominantly populated by African Americans who migrated from the south after Reconstruction. Flint can be viewed as a microcosm of America's poverty stricken urban areas. Once abandoned by General Motors, Flint became one of the poorest urban areas in the country. Flint Town Kids captures the bleak setting in which these Flint natives exist. It powerfully examines the hardships, the sufferings, mishaps and sacrifices made in order to persist in this town. Flint Town Kids highlights the frightening education system in Flint where schools are designed to produce basketball players only. On the other hand, students who are non basketball players are left with mediocre excuses for classrooms while adjusting to the lack of libraries needed to empower young minds. The documentary takes a very close look at children who bare the armor of strength in trying to escape Flint. Flint's has been successful in producing a legacy of basketball players ranging from playground hopefuls to the pros. The film highlights current and former NBA players such as Morris Peterson (Toronto Raptors), Eddie Robinson (Chicago Bulls), Trent Tucker and Glen Rice as well as Tracy McGrady (Houston Rockets) LeBron James, (Cleveland Caveliers), Jason Richardson (Golden State Warriors) Chucky Atkins (Boston Celtics) and Jonathan Bender (Indiana Pacers) who have achieved the dream of making it to the pros. For those who are not as fortunate to escape the nightmarish lifestyle that Flint brings, they embark on survival methods such as drugs and violence. Flint Town Kids brings to light the little faith left in the system. Children raising kids and kids age ten killing each other is just an everyday part of life in Flint. The documentary will depict those shocking scenes in the lives of children who are left with no choice but to make adult decisions in a world where only the fittest survive. For many adults the consuming goal of overcoming poverty lies in making cocaine. Flint Town Kids graphically explores this process which seems to have become the saving grace for many in a town that presents scarce positive outcomes for the future. Flint Town Kids will leave audiences outraged and enthralled with the African American lifestyle in an area that once presented promise only miles from the Motor City. Follow-up to Dollar Bill Y'All. Story revolves around the youth on the streets of Flint, Michigan and the choices they face. Several Flintown Kids grow up to be ballers, jumping right from high school to the NBA while others are faced to find other ways off the streets, like selling drugs and resorting to violence.

The hazards and consequences of this trade are explored, including the pan-African violence propagated by constant flow of weapons into the continent. If it is a \"survival of the fittest\" world, as Darwin concluded, then the capitalist interests that fund the gun runners are climbing the evolutionary ladder on the backs of the Africans in this stark Darwinian example.

Piet Zwart worked as an interior and industrial designer, commercial typographer, photographer, critic and lecturer, playing a key role in defining the design climate in the Netherlands in the Twentieth Century. He is especially known for designing the famous 'Piet Zwart' kitchen for the Dutch company Bruynzeel: a kitchen that could be easily produced and consisted of standardized elements. His versatility and influence on present-day designers led the Association of Dutch Designers to award him the title of \"Designer of the Century\" in 2000. Piet Zwart is counted among the international avant-garde without any reservations. His work reflects the work of artists such as Kurt Schwitters, El Lissitzky, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Jan Tschichold, but always retains its own authenticity. His work corresponded with similar experiments at the Bauhaus, where Piet Zwart was a teacher. This documentary enters the mind of the artist Piet Zwart with his almost obsessive urge to innovate.\n",

Antonio Lo Russo has experience with this type of mission, he was in Kosovo where he led an expedition that escorted human convoys, he was once in the army and so has military experience.

            "ID: 448, TITLE: Guidance Is Internal (2016), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: Two people find themselves on the precipice of romance. Their personal convergence parallels NASA's exploration of space and echoes of JFK's once and future dream. Specifically the Apollo 11 voyage to the moon and JFK's 1962 speech ennobling cosmic quests are entwined with our characters' encounter. The micro and macro of human life are showcased through cross-cutting techniques. Both narratives underscore our film's essential theme; that love is the essence of all exploration and it is indeed the greatest adventure of all. Space exploration of all scales is born out of our internal need to connect externally. The title, \"Guidance is Internal\", was originally uttered during the Apollo 11 launch countdown and serves as a thematic bridge between the two stories. On one hand, we have two characters whose internal desire to connect catalyzes their external actions to communicate. On the other hand, we have the culminating efforts of humanity literally reaching for the stars in hopes of better understanding our place in the universe. Ultimately, what does each existential excursion into the unknown grant us? An understanding that we are not alone. For our two characters, their connection is forged by a mutual understanding and feeling for life. For the human race, witnessing our planet from the heavens imbues in us with an understanding of our innate interconnectivity. In both cases, a greater harmony is achieved. This is the story of two potential lovers (Collin Varney and Sondra Glass) on a journey to connect, interwoven with the Apollo 11 Moon landing and JFK's rousing 1962 speech at Rice University. The over-arching theme of our interconnectivity through exploration and our subsequent place in the universe is personified through these duel narratives.\n",
            "ID: 449, TITLE: NorTec (2001), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the Nor-tec phenomenon emerged from the border city of Tijuana and through the Internet, quickly conquered a global audience. Marketed as a kind of \"ethnic\" electronic dance music, Nor-tec samples sounds of traditional music from the north of Mexico, and transforms them through computer technology used in European and American techno music and electronica. Tijuana has media links to both Mexico and the United States, with peoples, currencies, and cultural goods--perhaps especially music--from both sides circulating intensely within the city. Older residents and their more mobile, cosmopolitan-minded children thus engage in a constant struggle with identity and nationality, appropriation and authenticity. Nor-tec music in its very composition encapsulates this city's struggle, resonating with issues felt on the global level, while holding vastly different meanings to the variety of communities that embrace it. With an impressive hybrid of musicology, ethnomusicology, cultural and performance studies, urbanism, and border studies, this documentary explores all facets.\n",

In Borneo, one of their last island outposts, lives one today who is a legend. He's won more than just a kingdom, he's won human hearts. They gave him the name Kusasi. The Orangutan King is the story of Kusasi's life told to us by a remarkable witness. Dr Birute M. Galdikas has been researching orangutans in Borneo for over 40 years. Under the guidance of Louis Leakey, Galdikas joined Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey to become a pioneer of Great Ape field research. Together they were known as the 'trimates', or 'Leakey's Angels'. Yet while Goodall's chimpanzees and Fossey's gorillas were made familiar through films, the orangutans are still largely unknown to television audiences. Their solitary lives high in the tree canopy have made them difficult to follow and film. Now, for the first time, Dr Galdikas will draw audiences deep into the orangutan universe. With enthusiasm and insight she tells us this special story - taking us back 30 years and unfolding Kusasi's story with detail, energy, and the wonder that she still feels for the orangutan species. As a three year old orphan, Kusasi fell under the care of Galdikas in her forest research camp. But driven by a cunning and tenacious spirit Kusasi did not behave as the other ex-captive infants. From the moment he arrived until today, Galdikas has watched Kusasi fight to win back and then succeed at life in the wild. And he's achieved what had once seemed impossible, reaching the top of the power hierarchy and ruling for ten years. The people who work at Camp Leakey enjoy his charisma, and even those who only visit him in his forest kingdom are struck with awe. As Julia Roberts was in 1997. Her encounter with Kusasi was unplanned - becoming a tight clinch with an irritable 140 kilo beast, possessing the strength of ten men. But she was unharmed. Kusasi is not malicious, and he's respected as much for his indifference to humans as for his power over the other orangutans. Today his spirit still burns brightly but his physical strength is fading. His fights with the rogue males who cross his borders are weakening him and The Orangutan King is the last chance for us to see him in power. But the hope of this film is that he will not be the last of his kind to rule with such strength in his forests. If the forest destruction can be stopped, there is a long future for the considerable Kusasi bloodline.\n",

            "ID: 718, TITLE: Memoirs of a Medium (2015), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: There is currently a spiritual awakening happening worldwide. After being suppressed and told what is normal by religious institutions for long periods of history, people today can speak their mind and practice alternative beliefs as they wish. They are not fearful of any repercussions or any stigma attached. They are Spiritualists, and Spiritualism is here to stay. Memoirs of a Medium looks at the current spiritual revolution from the perspective of the people involved. We tell the true life story of Sean Conway as he comes to understand that he is a spiritual medium. Sean was just like any child growing up in the seventies, coming from a large family in a small house in Sligo. He spent his days exploring the countryside with his identical twin brother Liam. All seemed well by day, however by night Sean was being visited by strange visitors, people from the distant past. Petrified by fear, Sean told others of his experiences, but they fell on deaf ears. With nowhere to turn, not even his twin brother, he began to feel isolated and decided to not speak of it. Only when he meets Asha, his spiritual mother, does he discover his true calling, spiritual medium-ship. With change however, came resistance, from both his inner self and also the people around him. We explore how after first being frightened of ridicule, he now uses his gift to help others. Reflecting the complexity of medium-ship and spirituality as a religion, academic experts and grassroots activists explain this shift in beliefs and tell us what they are exactly. They tell of the benefits certain people gain from medium-ship. Shot on location in Ireland, Memoirs of a Medium reveals this new spiritual revolution. It asks what is a medium and how does one become one?\n",

            "ID: 803, TITLE: Arctic Window (1985), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: Filmed in the heart of Chicago, across the uninhabited Icelandic interior, and on the sea cliffs of volcanic Heimaey Island, the program provides a window to two lands and its people; one urban and American, the other, wild, wondrous, and inhabited by modern-day descendants of ancient Vikings, and to a delightful little bird that most of us would never get a chance to see. The film begins by tracking the expedition of the project's lead zoologist across the entire length of Iceland, taking in an amazing landscape of waterfalls, glaciers, hot springs and geysers and spending a day with a rural Icelandic family living on the country's north coast, only a few miles from the Arctic Circle. He then travels by ship to the only inhabited island in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, located off of Iceland's south coast. Here, the zoologist is joined by a handful of colleagues, who set to work on the steep coastal bluffs to humanely capture and crate for air transport to the U.S. several dozen newly-born, downy puffins. The film then shifts to Chicago, where the birds are held in quarantine at a remote site while the final touches are being put on the new building and seabird habitat they will live in. Here we join the building's architect and engineer as they guide us through the unique design, construction, and layers of complex technology and machinery required to create in terrain, temperature, and lighting of an exacting replica of Iceland ideal for the North Atlantic puffin, but located in the heart of Chicago's cityscape. Finally, the film records the puffins' arrival, veterinary examinations, and climatic entry into their new home that, for nearly 4 million zoo visitors per year -- and on a busy day, more than 200 busloads of city school children -- will provide a \"window to a world\" they've only heard of or read about in textbooks.\n",

The news media fans the flames, reporting record auction prices, celebrity parties and unfathomable sums of currency exchanged, in what has become a truly global commodity market. Animator and director, Drew Lightfoot steps in front of the camera for the first time. In Spotless, Drew leans on his experience behind the lens to document his journey into the world of contemporary art. From animation for feature films for Tim Burton, music videos for global artists and campaigns for major advertising agencies, nothing has prepared Drew for what he is about to uncover in Spotless. Drew will travel with a film crew around the globe attending an international exhibit of 'Spot Paintings' by the UK's most successful living artist, Damien Hirst, and in the end, be rewarded with a 'Spot' print of his own. With a potential projected value of up to two hundred thousand dollars per print, the opportunity to visit eleven galleries across three continents and collect a piece of art has promise to not only pay for the entire adventure but also yield a profit.

With the simultaneous explosion of the worldwide Occupy movement, how is it that, in the midst of so much economic distress, a polka-dotted painting can sell for 3.4 million dollars?

            "ID: 1202, TITLE: Exquisite Corpses (2011), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: Exquisite Corpses is a formal study that alludes to the decay of cinema and the advancing of digital film through a series of devolving images from the history of photography, and early motion picture technology. Director Dana Plays uses random chance operations of the exquisite corpse, by creating vertical triptychs, and mixed frame combinations, of stacked motion picture footage of Muybridge's horse in motion, Edison early toys with her own footage shot with a 16mm camera of the subway train arriving at the station, and animal locomotion study she shot in high speed digital cinematography. The exquisite corpse was a word and picture game used by the surrealists and later a child's game that evolved into a triptych of a drawing made with a paper folded in threes. Ultimately the film is a reflexive comment on narrativity as it interweaves image and text, of Plays' evolving historical project, the story of Ottilie Moore, her great aunt who provided safe haven for refuges, including the Jewish at Villa L'Hermitage, in Villefranche sur- Mer, in the late 30s and early 40s. Through complex structural and formal approaches, including vertical and horizontal structures, Plays visually explores the intersections between private and public histories, making metaphorical connections between location, setting and place, oral and written story telling and refers to the devolving process of history of motion picture film, from the silent era with use of inter-title text and image combinations. This piece was made by Plays using her digital JK Optical Printer optical printer to reprocess found footage she salvaged from dumpsters. The piece has evolved from a series of digital installations exhibited in Prague, Czech Republic, at the Skolska 28 Gallery, and an earlier permutation of this piece exhibited as part of the Film Lingual II exhibition, at C. Emerson Fine Arts Gallery in St. Petersburg Florida curated by Lori Johns.\n",

At the same time a woman has her jewels stolen and a government whistle blower arrives with his stolen top secret papers. All, of course have the same style and color overnight bag. This is the comic tale of four identical pieces of red plaid luggage and one San Francisco hotel, in the spirit of Howard Hawks but made by Peter Bogdanovich. One bag contains secret government files, another has expensive jewels and a third has igneous rocks. It is unclear what is in the fourth bag, carried by the would-be erudite Judy Maxwell...but all four bags end up at the Hotel Bristol. Judy has a yen for food and Dr. Howard Bannister and no \"off\" button. Dr. Bannister (deliciously deadpan and hunky, Ryan O'Neal) has a yen for igneous rock formations. When all four bags are hopelessly mixed up and Eunice, Howard's prim and bossy fiance (unforgettably played by Madeline Kahn) is kidnapped, only the long arm of the law, (i.e. the judiciary), can make any sense of the chaos. There are no palaeontologists or tigers but there are madcap antics, the obligatory San Francisco chase scenes and several clever one-liners.

With his straight laced and controlling fianc√©e Eunice Burns, Howard is in San Francisco to attend the Congress of American Musicologists convention hosted by Frederick Larrabee. The Larrabee Foundation has shortlisted two finalists for the $20,000 Larrabee Grant, the two being pompous Hugh Simon and Howard, whose research involves prehistoric man making music with igneous rocks. Howard's life in San Francisco is turned upside down when he meets Judy Maxwell, a klutzy, directionless but brilliant young woman whose life is spent studying at one educational institution after another, her stint at each being until she's kicked out. It's love at first sight for Judy, who does whatever she can to insinuate herself into Howard's life. Further complications ensue as Howard, Judy, wealthy Mrs. Van Hoskins and reporter Mr. Smith - the latter two who are staying at the same hotel as Howard - all have the identical red plaid overnight bag respectively carrying Howard's igneous rocks, Judy's clothes, Mrs. Van Hoskins jewels and top secret government documents, the latter two which are eyed by others who are trying to get their hands on the contents.\n",

            "ID: 1225, TITLE: We've Got It Simple (2015), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: \"WE'VE GOT IT SIMPLE\" - A feature length documentary film that will expose and celebrate the wondrous glow of the completely creative, uniquely artistic and often obsessively fanatical world of Phish fans! What started with a single show way back in 1983 has since blossomed into a three decade long career of four virtuoso musicians and one of the most unique and fascinating bands to ever grace a stage. While PHISH approached the 30th anniversary of the band's first show, Philly Philms began pre-production on \"We've Got It Simple\" while touring with the band in the summer, fall and holiday tours of 2013. While traversing the lots with his camera in hand, director Mike Lawrence, a Phish fan himself for nearly 20 years shot interviews and B-roll from coast to coast while building a strong base for the film and full production which shoots through 2014. From the earliest days in Vermont to the 30th Anniversary shows in Madison Square Garden, Phish fans have changed and evolved alongside the band. The unique community that has spawned from the band and their music is the focus of the film with a specific slant on the creative and artistic world that Phish fans reside in. From the smallest trinkets sold on lot that allow fans to \"tour\" with the band each year to the established worlds of pin and poster artists, Phish fans have in sense created an underground art collective made up entirely of fans of the band, who create, sell, trade and very often give art to each other in the community. What began as a simple means to pay for the next show has blossomed into a highly creative sub-culture that deserves to be celebrated. Further, this sub-culture is really a legitimate community of people, from all over the country and from all walks of life. A community that thrives on positive energy and is fueled by music. This community exists and is a direct result of one thing, the band Phish and their music. Their intent is all for our delight, and always has been. We've Got It Simple.. we truly do. So not only is this film an attempt to shed some light on such an eclectic and amazing community that we are a part of but also as a way to say thank you to the band. In the end, all of us Phish heads will have collectively created a film, a piece of permanent art, that will not only tell our story from the inside-out but also serve as a 30th Anniversary Gift from us, the fans.. to them, the band!\n",

Few are aware of the theater's impact on the life and career of Steven Spielberg and Michael Landon, or how she effected and played a part in history of other major films including The Exorcist and Kramer v. Kramer. A boarded up time capsule, a relic of a day of bygone old vaudeville-movie theater palaces, her story is captured by a curious filmmaker, Brent J.

They track down projectionists, ushers, ticket sellers, moviegoers from the theater and place them back in their locations to tell their stories.

And, as it turns out, the film also witnesses one of the most significant discoveries about climate change in recent Antarctic science. Intense public focus on climate change has turned the shores of Antarctica into a new tourist mecca, making the earth's coldest continent the hot place to be. But, inland from the penguins and ice floes is a magical Antarctica of volcanoes, boulder-strewn valleys and ominous glaciers. Only a small number of scientific research teams get there, braving severe conditions to learn about our planet's history, and make predictions about our future. ICE PEOPLE heads out into the \"deep field\" with noted geologists Allan Ashworth and Adam Lewis, and two undergrad scientists-in-the-making, where they scour across hundreds of miles to find tiny, critical signs of ancient life. Their findings would give the first evidence of a green Antarctica over 14 million years ago, that disappeared with a sudden shift in the temperature of the continent. The most authentic film about life on the ice since the trailblazing expeditions to Antarctica chronicled nearly a century ago, ICE PEOPLE conveys the vast beauty, the claustrophobia, the excitement and the stillness of an experience set to nature's rhythm.\n",

These are dramatic scenes which Brecht wrote and had his own actors rehearse as preparation for full-length productions of the corresponding Shakespeare plays. The scenes reduce the \"heroic\" stature of the Shakespearean characters by showing them as ordinary people with the usual needs and vices, living in a world where economics is inevitably more influential than principle. The idea, in Socialist East Germany where Brecht lived and worked, was that the actors' own egos would be deflated by these scenes, and the result would be a more \"human\" portrayal. The scenes were therefore rehearsed but then omitted from actual performance of the full play.\n",

            "ID: 1410, TITLE: Welcome to Nollywood (2007), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The Nigerian film industry, known as Nollywood, has exploded in the last ten years. Now the most popular cinema in all of west Africa--even more popular than imports of Hollywood or Bollywood films--the Nigerian film industry has distinguished itself by shooting all films (called video films) on digital video. This has allowed production schedules to be compressed (films are shot in several days) and immediately brought to market (distribution consists of bringing films to Idumota electronics market in Lagos and selling them for home viewing). The sheer volume of Nigerian video films is staggering: one estimate has a film being produced for each day of the year. Nollywood is now the third-largest film industry in the world, generating US$286 million a year for the Nigerian economy. And yet this vibrant, profitable industry is virtually unknown outside of Africa. Jamie Meltzer, director of \"Off the Charts: The Song Poem Story,\" which premiered on PBS' prestigious Independent Lens series has created a fascinating look into this newly emerging film industry, exploring its peculiar inner workings, economic challenges, and diverse array of colorful films. Traveling to the country's chaotic capitol, Lagos, Meltzer spent six weeks following three of Nigeria's hottest directors, each different in personality and style, as they shot their films about love, betrayal, war, and the supernatural. \"Welcome to Nollywood\" tells the stories of these three directors and their latest productions, while also using interviews with scholars, actors, and journalists who celebrate the industry in insightful and often humorous ways, the Nigerian video-film industry as a whole, its unique character and genres, as well as its impact on the culture of west Africa and Africans at home and abroad.\n",

The film follows a select group of parking lot attendants and their strange rite of passage. The eccentric brotherhood of attendants consist of grad students, overeducated philosophers, surly artists, middle-age slackers and more. This self-described \"ragtag group of fractured poets\" prefer skateboards and bicycles to cars and have at best a tolerant contempt for the people they serve. That's not to say they don't care about anything. They hang out at the lot even in their spare time, shooting the breeze or playing a spirited game of \"flip cone,\" just because...they like it there. They conduct their own private \"war\" against the elites, the pretentious and obnoxious customers who park their BMWs, Hummers, Suburbans and other vehicles. They study the art of doing nothing and the knack of getting even with rude, SUV-driving dolts who treat them like inferior beings. The gradual devolution from enthusiasm to resentment in the psyches of guys self-aware enough to notice it is an interesting process; in an attempt to distract themselves from the rapidly mounting bitterness, the attendants amuse themselves any way they can-stenciling random messages on the parking gate, writing songs, even dancing for tips. Through interviews with former attendants who have moved on - we see that their time at the lot has clearly provided rites of passage and afforded them Zen-like perspective. As one parking attendant laments, \"We had it all in a world that had nothing to offer us.\" If the intersection between the status quo and the quest for freedom is their ultimate challenge, could a slab of asphalt be an emotional way station for The American Dream?\n",

            "ID: 1507, TITLE: Everyday Life's Changing Moods (2008), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: The film Everyday life's changing moods is a kind of search for personal maps of our hidden thoughts during the process of creation. Just like in a diary moments in everyday life are revealed in this film as a site of desires and fears, but in its essence it explores ideas which are constructing (or deconstructing) any work of art. Everyday life's changing moods is made out of intertwined visual and textual elements. However, the subconscious treatment of text in contrast to the conscious use of visual narrative forces the elements to oppose each other. The text becomes a gesture and visual images turn to contents. Both words and pictures are leading to disruption of a fine line between public and private making the clear reading of present reality unable. The film examines the interconnections between me and others; gender and identity illustrated as our connection to the external world as we search for the internal. Through simulated reality, simulated personal point of view, false surrealism, through words and sentences which strive to reconstruct tacitly the visual, the main issues of this film are: simulations of ability to be aware of feelings and imaginations through processes of creation. The intimacy of the artist is brought to be public - this procedure reveals itself as primarily artistic method in producing any work of art.\n",

Some are temps, some aren't, but they're all dealing with a workplace impelled by turnover and increasing corporate hegemony. Raised in a basically privileged world of middle-class America - and always told they could do and be anything - these characters are challenged both by having so many options, and by their quests for perfection. This generation is the first one that cannot live better than its parents: a job is no longer a life-long career choice. In today's world that pressures workers to sacrifice their personal lives for \"success,\" the five learn that, although life is full of compromises, they can find fulfillment. ALLY works as a \"long-term temp\" to insure time for making her film. As film is the modern medium for an artist's coming-of-age story, Ally represents the post-baby-boom generation's Everywoman - someone struggling to express herself creatively through work she loves.

He wants to settle down; but Ally doesn't, as she resists his pressure on her to \"get a real job.\" While he loves her freewheeling creativity, Ben worries he will never achieve a life of stability with her, and so he sets an ultimatum: three months for Ally to decide what matters most to her - settling down with him or continuing her life of working temp jobs to pay the bills. High-spirited and unconventional, JANE wants a job free from \"hypocrisy.\" She finds progressively wacky employment - gynecological model, stripper, etc. - in her search for \"the Right Job.\" GEORGIA is a computer software designer who dreams of creating an interactive encyclopedia.

JONAH has come out to his friends and family, but has not yet become comfortable with the idea of having a steady boyfriend. He has recently quit his job as a lawyer to write the great American Novel. Not meant to be an artist, however, and continually fired from temp jobs, he sinks into lethargy and aimlessness until he can no longer afford his apartment and must return home to live with his parents. Explors the conflicting pressures of professional and personal choices that are a part of the new American workplace.\n",

            "ID: 1564, TITLE: Post No Bills (1991), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: Political heavy-weights populate this urgent and humorous documentary on the detonative mix of art and politics as embodied in the work of infamous \"guerilla\" poster artist Robbie Conal, a professional painter who estimates that hundreds of thousands of his caricatured paintings-as-posters have been splattered across the United States' urban streets, militantly affixed by himself and his cult following of urban guerilla volunteers to construction sites, traffic light switching boxes and any other surface area large enough to house one of these satirical images. Specializing in what he calls \"info-tainment,\" Conal's posters offer an immediate response to today's headlines through the expressionistically decaying depiction of the socially and politically powerful accompanied by several words of dichotomous text. Beginning in 1986 with the onset of the Iran-Contra scandal, Conal has distributed his work in a way even Andy Warhol might not have dreamed possible. As Conal modestly points out, \"these are some of the most famous paintings of any contemporary artist because I make you see them whether you want to or not.\" The original canvases, from which the posters are reproduced, simultaneously grace elite gallery walls and wealthy collectors' homes. Post No Bills foregrounds the tension between Conal's creative process and the lures of a desperate notoriety achieved through catering to the newsmedia's craving for controversy in his journey to express himself and benefit from the notoriety generated from his endeavors. In September 1990, after \"reasonably outspoken\" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates casually stated that \"casual drug users ought to be taken out and shot,\" Conal began collaboration with student Patrick Crowley on a poster criticizing this hyperbolic remark. When an outraged world focused on Los Angeles in March of 1991 with the release of the graphic video footage of the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers, Conal and Crowley took to the L.A. streets his most daring, inciting and inflammatory image to date; a poster depicting the police chief on a full torso N.R.A. shooting target with the text \"casual drug users ought to be taken out and beaten. Post No Bills concentrates on this poster of Gates, including an interview with the beleaguered Chief himself, celebrating the potential of this piece of political street art and exposing the dissociation to be made between Conal and his subject matter. A documentary look at artist Robbie Conal. Conal paints political posters and then organizes gangs of folks to plaster them up all over town. The film visits his L.A. studio as he paints and as he turns out posters; he talks about his work. We also watch his volunteers out on the streets putting up the posters, and we see the cityscape decorated with his art. The soundtrack includes public utterances by Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Ollie North, Tammy Faye Baker, and others whom Conal's guerrilla art skewers.\n",

These dehumanizing caricatures permeated popular culture from the 1820s to the Civil Rights period and implanted themselves deep in the American psyche. Narration by Esther Rolle and commentary by respected scholars shed light on the origins and devastating consequences of this 150 yearlong parade of bigotry. Ethnic Notions situates each stereotype historically in white society's shifting needs to justify racist oppression from slavery to the present day.

A retro neon sign looms over the lazy hum of city traffic. But behind the row of uniform doors an all-too-human drama is playing out in the shadows. In one room, an elderly Cuban American, the very image of traditional breadwinner, waits for one of his several, younger girlfriends.

Entering a world of infidelity and delusion, the documentary fashions a compassionate account of love, loss and the tangled webs we weave.

The extraction and the consumption of these resources in the past two centuries have changed our climate and ecosystems so significantly, that a new geological era had to be created. For some decades now people have been talking about saving the planet, but we are realizing that this is not really the issue. The central issue is civilization itself and whether we can save it. The stresses that we have put on the earth are not only threatening our habitat, but our way of life, our prosperity and even our existence on the planet. Our current paradigm must change. We will have to accept the new reality; the human economy is part of nature and not the other way around. We are faced with great challenges, but unlike the rest of the living world, we have the unique ability to adapt and decide our fate and the fate of most of the biosphere, for better or worse, in order to survive the human project.\n",

His art blended the beautiful and the decadent, the religious and the obscene, the light and the shade, like never before.

She didn't plan to respect his last will, which was to run the farm, but loses her job and is forced to accept hosting a new 'green' program. In order to keep it, she must pay off a $75,000 mortgage. To that end, she hopes to win the pumpkin growing contest using grandpa's winning seed line and cultivation log. Neighbor Seth Cullen, the town's handyman (and actually a Stanford engineering graduate), has a hard time convincing her they need to team up. Seattle radio call-in show host Emma Silver is called back to the small town of Valleyville, a three hour drive away, upon learning of the death of her paternal grandfather, farmer Walt Silver. Like every farmer in Valleyville, Walt primarily grew pumpkins, as Valleyview holds a competitive annual pumpkin growing contest. Emma has not been back to Valleyville, where she used to visit all the time as a child, since the tragic death of her parents when they were visiting there while Emma was away at college. As she is his only next of kin, Walt deeds the farm to Emma, despite he knowing she knows nothing about farming, and deeds her a few seeds from his last award winning pumpkin, the latest in a lineage. In a note to her, he asks her to make sure the spirit of his legacy in the farm is preserved, if not by her than by someone she trusts will honor it. He also mentions that he hopes she can deal with issues that he could not during his life, which she learns is a $75,000 mortgage on the farm, due at the end of the current year's growing season. Walt's death also leads to Emma getting to know some of her new Valleyview neighbors, some of who have an agenda. Valleyville Mayor Kyle Finster, who is also the bank manager, wants Emma to sell Walt's farm to a developer, in the name of the town's \"progress\", and to foreclose if need be to get that to happen. And Emma's next door neighbor, Seth Cullen, who earns a living as a mechanic running such a business on his farm, wants to buy some of Walt's pumpkin seeds in an effort to open his own garage on Main Street to compete against Mighty Muffler, a chain outfit coming to town as part of the Mayor's progress. Emma also learns that Seth's plan involves winning the pumpkin growing contest, which has the potential of a $50,000 prize if the world record of 1,878 pounds for a single pumpkin is broken. In combination with work issues resulting from a corporate merger, Emma decides to stay on the farm for the season to try and win that $50,000 prize to save the farm. As Emma tries to learn all she can about farming, including the secrets of the other locals and of her late grandfather, she may come to the realization of who may be best to look after Walt's legacy in the long term, and what she herself wants for her life.\n",

Spanning a period of 22 years these films revolve skittishly around human nature, and apart from the more documentary Life in Denmark, each has actor Claus Nissen as Leth's artful alter ego. Nissen and Maiken Algren are in an empty white room with only the essential props for each scene. A bed, bedding, a table, chairs. \"We are going to see the perfect human being in action\", we hear, and Leth's voice puts descriptive or puzzled words to the little actions the film exhibits: the man touches his face investigatively, fills a pipe, cuts his nails, and gets undressed, but he does peculiar things, too: he jumps as if he is weightless, snaps his fingers in strange ways, and dances with exaggerated movements and no music. \"Today, too, I had an experience that I hope I shall understand in a few days' time\", he ponders. The whole film is staged with great clarity in its picture compositions with several characteristic zooms to indicate the bodily parts of the perfect human being, and emphasis on the light, boundless nothingness of the room. The soundtrack reveals tones of a clarinet touching on the stylistically consistent visuals. At its premiere at the Carlton cinema The Perfect Human was shown before Jean-Luc Godard's La Chinoise.\n",

            "ID: 22378, TITLE: Blitze (2000), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: The Sixth Sense. If two letters in the original German title of Dietmar Brehm's new film were changed, it could be translated as Glances. The result would be coordinates of a mode of vision in which subject and object oscillate: A glance triggers flashes of lightening in the brain; synaptic activity during a dream replaces the glance. A man opens his eyes. He sees a cozy room with a burning fireplace; he sees an elderly person lying in the bed and then turning to ring for a servant; he sees a woman taking a shower, and a younger one in bed asleep. Suddenly, all order is reversed. It may be that the woman is merely dreaming of a voyeur; she may be entering REM sleep. She might be dreaming herself into an altered version of Psycho. The feeling of discomfort caused by Bolts of Lightening is made possible by the relevance Brehm adds to his found footage: He permits the telling of a story which is turned completely around and, as in a dream, the story is nothing more than a subsequent synthesis of images which appear suddenly; beauty and transience are not just subjects, they are also a quality of the film's images.\n",

We have explored much of the known galaxy and encountered alien life forms that have threatened human existence. The galaxy is a big place, and we have only explored 8% of our own galaxy. After the resource wars on Earth in the late 21st Century, humans had no choice but to explore and exploit resources outside their home planet Earth. After 200 years of expansion, the humans spanned many solar systems and a number of colonies were formed. Financed by MAG industries the humans slowly spread across the galaxy and encountered the horrors of Deep Space and the unknown. Many forms of indigenous life was found on many worlds and two intelligent alien races have been discovered. The Antarians where a peaceful race and helped us reach new levels of technology, we also encountered the Grelem who were a hostile race. The humans managed to prevail after a 60 year struggle of war and dominance. The first and only inter-galactic war humans endured made them stronger and prepared them for a new darkness which was to descend upon the galaxy. The CDF endures today to keep rebellious colonies in line as well as serve as the main defense and security force for Earth and her colonies. Space is one of the most hostile environments known to mankind, but in order to survive and evolve as a species we must explore and find new worlds people will one day call home.

            "ID: 22428, TITLE: Orwell's Revolution (2017), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: Before writing 1984, Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War against the forces of Fascism. Joining the POUM Militia, he believed that if Fascism could be defeated in Spain it would halt the rise of Hitler. Along the way Orwell would encounter another enemy. One that would transform him and lead him to write his dystopian masterpiece, 1984. Featuring an interview with Noam Chomsky, 'Orwell's Revolution' explores Orwell's account of these experiences in Homage to Catalonia. As Chomsky is one of the few scholars to agree with Orwell's take on the Spanish Civil War, the film explores our notions of history. With Ivens' classic film \"The Spanish Earth\" as its guide, \"Orwell's Revolution,\" develops a parallel narrative that explores the notion of documentary truth. Through techniques first developed by Ivens, it examines the origins of the modern documentary, questioning why it uses images that motivate rather than inform. The two narratives come together when it is realized that Iven's film is in conflict with Orwell's text. In a treatment that combines interviews, archival films and historical documents, Orwell's Revolution weaves an intricate web where the viewer is shown how history is written. It turns out that fake news has been with us for a long time. Even Hemingway was part of the game when he attacked Orwell's POUM in 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.'\n",

            "ID: 22437, TITLE: An Ordinary Killer (2003), GENRE: thriller, DESCRIPTION: The tragic real life story of a serial killer who stalked his victims in the early 1970's in small town America. A weaving trail of twists and turns that left people unsettled for two generations until investigative persistence aided by modern technology brings justice for a young mother and her family some 28 years later. The film, An Ordinary Killer reflects the ultimate success story in the intriguing world of forensic investigation. This amazing movie captures the early beginnings of two important investigative techniques that are routinely used in today's criminal investigations, those being the scientific process of DNA technology and the behavioral approach of criminal psychological profiling. At the time of the murder of a young woman in 1973 in a Michigan community, DNA technology and psychological profiling were unheard of by most criminal investigators. At that time I was serving as a criminologist in the FBI's newly organized Behavioral Science Unit and attempting to convince the law enforcement community that criminal profiling could be useful in a murder investigation and was not akin to voodoo. It seems a detective in Michigan working a murder investigation of a young woman got my message and was inspired and motivated. Above all, An Ordinary Killer captures the basic qualities of investigative tenacity that separate those cases that go unsolved to the success story depicted in this compelling drama that spanned several decades. Tony Hornus has produced an important incentive to the law enforcement field to never give up on a crime of violence and to try new forensic techniques. He has also produced an important educational message to the general public concerning the tedious work that goes on in a murder investigation. But most importantly, Tony Hornus has issued a warning to the dark side of society, that being, \"If you commit a crime of violence, you will be caught, no matter how long it takes to catch you.\"\n",

            "ID: 47261, TITLE: \"Greed\" (1999), GENRE: game-show, DESCRIPTION: A five-person team, headed by a captain and determined by a random sweepstakes drawing, must work their way up the Tower of Greed to a jackpot of $2,000,000. The catch: during the course of the game, each team member has the chance to eliminate another member and take their cash by challenging them to a one-question showdown known as \"The Terminator.\" In the wake of ABC's successful _\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\" (1999)_, Fox created \"Greed,\" advertising a possible $2 million jackpot for successful contestants. Six contestants were invited onstage to answer a question with a numeric answer (e.g., \"To the nearest billion, how many customers has McDonald's served as of 1998?\"). The contestant coming closest to the correct answer served as team captain for the five-member team; the contestants having the next four closest guesses rounded out the \"Team for Greed,\" which attempted to climb the \"Tower of Greed\" for the $2 million jackpot. In the first round, host Woolery asked, in turn, each of the four contestants a general-knowledge, multiple-choice question (the first worth $25,000 and increasing by that amount up to $100,000) ; the captain could either accept or reject an answer and replace it with one of other choices. Subsequent questions (the first worth $200,000, the second $500,000 and the third $1 million) had multiple answers (a la \"According to McDonald's, what are the four most popular hamburger toppings or condiments?\") ; between six and nine possible answers were shown, of which only four were correct. Everyone, including the team captain, provided at least one answer; the team captain could eliminate one incorrect answer by using a special one time-use token. The team captain could accept or change any of the answers (besides his/her own). Before the answers were revealed, Woolery offered the captain a cash or prize buyout ($100,000 split among the team members, or each receive the keys to a new Jaguar sedan in addition to a $250,000 cash split). The team captain (who always received a larger share of the cash, unless Woolery indicated otherwise) could decide to quit with their winnings at any time or risk them on the next question. If the team was still in contention for the top prize after the $1 million question, each of the team members could stop and take their winnings thus far or buy into the final $2 million question. An incorrect answer at any point in the game not only ended that team's chances for the jackpot, but caused the team to lose all their \"Tower of Greed\" winnings. At several intervals of the game (the first coming after the initial series of four questions), the \"Terminator\" selected a contestant, who was offered a guaranteed $10,000, regardless of what happened later; he/she then could choose to face-off against a team member in a one-question showdown. Woolery sked a toss-up question; the contestant answering correctly continued to play (possibly replacing the team captain), and the loser was eliminated. Big winners and memorable contestants could return to later shows to answer an additional multiple-answer question for $1 million; their earlier winnings were safe.\n",

The cowboy and the suburbanite. The conservative and the liberal. And yet these two artists (a word both men scoffed at) were the best of friends, right up to their deaths a mere seven weeks apart in 1961. But is the friendship of these two men really so surprising? A study of these two men is a study of the 20th century. Their internationally renowned careers (Cooper, two Best Actor Academy Awards; Hemingway, Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes) were played out over the same turbulent decades: the hedonistic 20s, the grim Depression 30s, the war-ravaged 40s, and the deceptively slumbering 50s; throughout, their public and private lives connected, parted, re-connected, intertwined, over-lapped, and collided. It is no small irony that the lives of these two men should suffer untimely ends at the dawn of the erupting sixties. Their final, poignant chapter closed at the beginning of a decade which would challenge many of the very ideals and precepts which both men so prominently represented.And yet, decades later, we have Liam Neeson reflecting: \"...the character of Bryan Mills (Taken) fits into a cinematic iconic figure that we all recognize from way back ... I'm thinking of Gary Cooper in High Noon, who is kind of a Bryan Mills. That kind of iconic figure that audiences seem to be attracted to.\"Perhaps Cooper and Hemingway didn't really pass the torch, perhaps they merely leant it.\n",

This short documentary shows the intimacy of a communal creative project, it explores the creative process, especially regarding clay work, and it explores the role of place in creativity, as an old building in a post-industrial town which was scheduled for demolition finds new life as an arts center. The ceramicists are Doug Jeck, long a prominent worker in the field. The other is Christine Golden, who once did a paper on Doug Jeck when she was in graduate school. Christine won the inaugural $20,000 Zanesville Prize in Contemporary Ceramics, and when Doug Jeck saw her prize-winning piece the next year, when he was a judge in the next competition, he knew this was someone he wanted to work with. The film documents, day by day, how the two artists craft a startling and stunning array of psyches, gazes, and visages. Zanesville, once a rich and bustling town because of its industrial clay production, now one more of the many sagging post-industrial cities in the Midwest, is in the process of reinventing itself with an arts and culture identity. The Zanesville Prize is a key element of this movement, as is the Pioneer School Zanesville (PSZ) project. Duet captures the kind of creativity Zanesville is just beginning to attract.\n",

All aspects are systematically measured and tracked by professionals and various field experts. Then, as quickly as I have deconstructed, the rebuilding process shall begin.

            "ID: 47352, TITLE: \"The All New Jeopardy!\" (1978), GENRE: game-show, DESCRIPTION: A short-lived revival of the old Merv Griffen quiz show. Similar to most other quiz shows, except for one twist: the host gave the answers, to which the contestants would then have to supply the questions. The show would become more successful in its later incarnation with host Alex Trebek. Short-lived revival of the classic Merv Griffin-produced game show, where contestants must supply the questions to answers. Three contestants, one a returning champion, competed. While the basic rules were identical to the 1964-1975 version (i.e., answer in the form of a question, dollar values to questions added or subtracted as appropriate, daily doubles, etc.), there were a number of rule changes adopted for this version. Most notably, the lowest-scoring contestant after the Jeopardy! round was eliminated from further play, while only the top-scoring contestant at the end of the Double Jeopardy! round got to compete in an entirely new endgame, called Super Jeopardy! In Super Jeopardy!, the contestant had to provide the correct questions to five answers either horizontally, vertically or diagonally; up to three incorrect questions were allowed. Getting five correct questions won a $5,000 bonus (plus $2,500 for each show the endgame was not won); a third incorrect question stopped Super Jeopardy! (all previous winnings for that show were considered safe). Contestants continued until winning five games or defeated.\n",

The town lay on the border between East and West and for decades served as the most important and most guarded border crossing of the Iron Curtain. Many here worked for 'the system', sometimes forced, as Stasi officer, guard, accountant or waitress. In this hermetically closed-off border town, where no westerner or outsider was allowed, the villagers formed a tight-knit community, caring for each other and creating a pleasant atmosphere. Yet, everyone knew that no one could truly be trusted. Criticism was unwelcome and even close friends could be informants. Now, almost 25 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, this documentary shows how the people of Marienborn are haunted by their past. Conflicting feelings of guilt, regret and a longing for their former sense of community have resulted in a lonely mutual silence. Meanwhile, the once-isolated community is flooded by outside visitors. Tourists ask imposing questions, pilgrims search for healing at the village's Holy well and an African asylum seeker, who ended up here by chance, tries to understand how the villagers live together. Being suspicious while falling under suspicion. Looking, while being watched. In this documentary the closed-off community of Marienborn lives as if in a claustrophobic dream while trying to reconcile with the past.\n",

Presented with thousands of dollars for gifts and charges from the night before, she immediately cancels his charge accounts and returns as many gifts as she can. Then she puts Mark on a allowance of $50 a week, which upsets him even more. To get rid of Lucy, Mark moves in with her and makes sure that her boyfriend Tom receives a huge raise. He thinks that Tom will now marry Lucy and he will be rid of her tight control. Judge Sam Coulter presides over an appeals case where young attorney Lucy Duncan fights not just for the principle but for the measly and complete $35 to which she feels her client is entitled. She is so inclined since she, as a working girl who is trying to save enough money to get married to her fianc√© Tom Winters, knows the value of hard work in earning money, almost to the exclusion of all else. Because of her bulldog nature, Judge Coulter hires her to administer the spendthrift clause of the trust of Mark MacLene IV, a wealthy but irresponsible playboy who owes $1.5 million to creditors and in back taxes, but who has no concept of managing money and thus who is on track to wipe out his entire trust in short order because of his extravagant spending habits. Mark welcomes the pretty Lucy into his life until he finds out what her role is.

Both use reverse psychology in getting what they want. But in the process, they fall in love.

            "ID: 47452, TITLE: Who Killed the Electric Car? (2006), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: With gasoline prices approaching $4/gallon, fossil fuel shortages, unrest in oil producing regions around the globe and mainstream consumer adoption and adoption of the hybrid electric car (more than 140,000 Prius' sold this year), this story couldn't be more relevant or important. The foremost goal in making this movie is to educate and enlighten audiences with the story of this car, its place in history and in the larger story of our car culture and how it enables our continuing addiction to foreign oil. This is an important film with an important message that not only calls to task the officials who squelched the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, but all of the other accomplices, government, the car companies, Big Oil, even Eco-darling Hydrogen as well as consumers, who turned their backs on the car and embrace embracing instead the SUV. Our documentary investigates the death and resurrection of the electric car, as well as the role of renewable energy and sustainable living in our country's future; issues which affect everyone from progressive liberals to the neo-conservative right. As a result of their development of a solar powered vehicle for a competition, General Motors decided in the late 1980's to develop a fully functional and affordable electric powered car. The resulting vehicles were high powered, zero emission, but could only run for approximately 100 miles on a charge, which is sufficient for most day to day driving. Because they knew that the technology was feasible and because of the global warming phenomenon resulting from the uncontrolled burning of fossil fuels, California state regulators passed the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate in 1990, requiring all auto makers to offer for sale in the state zero emission vehicles. The electric car was the most promising technology at the time. It was argued that they were more environmentally friendly than conventional vehicles, even if the electricity was produced through burning coal. Under pressure from all the auto makers who sued the California Air Resources Board, the mandate was revoked in 2003. Despite lessees who loved their electric vehicles, all the auto makers repossessed their electric vehicles and refused to re-lease or sell the vehicles even to their existing users. Many forces seemed to be working against making electric vehicles available, despite technology itself making their production and operation feasible.\n",

In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg shook America to its foundations when he smuggled a top-secret Pentagon study to the New York Times that showed how five Presidents consistently lied to the American people about the Vietnam War that was killing millions and tearing America apart. President Nixon's National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger called Ellsberg \"the most dangerous man in America,\" who \"had to be stopped at all costs.\" But Ellsberg wasn't stopped. Facing 115 years in prison on espionage and conspiracy charges, he fought back. Ensuing events surrounding the so-called Pentagon Papers led directly to Watergate and the downfall of President Nixon, and hastened the end of the Vietnam War. Ellsberg's relentless telling of truth to power, which exposed the secret deeds of an \"Imperial Presidency,\" inspired Americans of all walks of life to forever question the previously-unchallenged pronouncements of its leaders. \"The Most Dangerous Man in America\" tells the inside story, for the first time on film, of this pivotal event that changed history and transformed our nation's political discourse. It is told largely by the players of that dramatic episode-Ellsberg, his colleagues, family and critics; Pentagon Papers authors and government officials; Vietnam veterans and anti-war activists; Watergate principals, attorneys and the journalists who both covered the story and were an integral part of it; and finally-through White House audiotapes-President Nixon and his inner circle of advisors.\n",

            "ID: 47692, TITLE: Northern Soul: Living for the Weekend (2014), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The northern soul phenomenon was the most exciting underground British club movement of the 1970s. At its high point, thousands of disenchanted white working class youths across the north of England danced to obscure, mid-60s Motown-inspired sounds until the sun rose. A dynamic culture of fashions, dance moves, vinyl obsession and much more grew up around this - all fuelled by the love of rare black American soul music with an express-train beat. Through vivid first-hand accounts and rare archive footage, this film charts northern soul's dramatic rise, fall and rebirth. It reveals the scene's roots in the mod culture of the 1960s and how key clubs like Manchester's Twisted Wheel and Sheffield's Mojo helped create the prototype that would blossom in the next decade. By the early 1970s a new generation of youngsters in the north were transforming the old ballrooms and dancehalls of their parents' generation into citadels of the northern soul experience, creating a genuine alternative to mainstream British pop culture. This was decades before the internet, when people had to travel great distances to enjoy the music they felt so passionate about. Set against a rich cultural and social backdrop, the film shows how the euphoria and release that northern soul gave these clubbers provided an escape from the bleak reality of their daily lives during the turbulent 1970s. After thriving in almost total isolation from the rest of the UK, northern soul was commercialized and broke nationwide in the second half of the 70s. But just as this happened, the once-healthy rivalry between the clubs in the north fell apart amidst bitter in-fighting over the direction the scene should go. Today, northern soul is more popular than ever, but it was back in the 1970s that one of the most fascinating and unique British club cultures rose to glory. Contributors include key northern soul DJs like Richard Searling, Ian Levine, Colin Curtis, Kev Roberts, alongside Lisa Stansfield, Norman Jay, Pete Waterman, Marc Almond, Peter Stringfellow and others.\n",

Stolen and adapted by other religions, it has spawned hundreds of sects and cults. Experts say much of what we read in today's version is riddled with deception and diversion, however there are also sacred and ancient secrets hidden within. The truth about the marriage of Jesus Christ to Mary Magdalene and their children; the real name of Jesus Christ and his unusual origins; the total destruction of the Tower of Babel by a strange alien race called the Anunnaki; Sodom and Gommorah being destroyed by a nuclear explosion; and even the hidden mathematical code that holds within it divine revelation about future events. Explore and investigate the latest theories and research and discover the real secrets of the Bible. A pseudo intellectual drones on and on trying to convince himself and others that there is no validity to the Bible. Cherry picked verses with no context mishmashed together with Google searched synopses of world mythology, astrology, astronomy and he even mentions geology once or twice in a sophomoric attempt to discredit Faith. I was reminded of a poorly paid professor at a no name college attempting to convince someone he has something intelligent to convey.

From conflicts of interests in politics and unregulated corporate power, to a news media that serves the interests of powerful elites; ETHOS explores the systems that lead us into over consumption and warfare. Too often the media celebrates aspects of our society that belong in the dark ages, while at the same time ignoring or ridiculing progressive thinking or ideas. Many aspects of the way our systems work almost guarantee our destruction as a society and that's what this film is about. Fractured societies, poverty, disparity, pollution, warfare. Is there something inherently wrong with the human race? Is that what we should think of ourselves? We have tried to set up forms of law and government that safeguard the public good. But, if the majority of people want to live in peace and justice in a clean environment and we look around at the world and see that isn't the case, then is our democracy broken? Every time we turn on the TV there is another environmental catastrophe. Our water, our air, poisoned. Why do we allow this? The news shows endless reels of starving refugees fleeing to escape war zones. Why are we still fighting endless wars? Why do we live like this? If these things are happening then they are the logical outcomes to the way our systems work. So, what is wrong with the system? And more importantly, how can we fix it? These are the question Ethos attempts to answer.\n",

            "ID: 47950, TITLE: Into the Night: Portraits of Life and Death (2017), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: We don't know how. We don't know when. But death comes for us all. To be human is to wrestle with this truth and with the great unanswered question: How do we live with death in our eye? To borrow from Dylan Thomas (whose poem opens the film): Do we go gently or raging against the dying light? Or between these two extremes? Do we depart with equanimity or with anger? With clenched fists or more commonly with denial? Or do we see death as something to be fought and even possibly conquered, a challenge increasing pursued by some of the brightest scientific minds. Finally, what are the stories we tell ourselves as we go into the night - or into the light? \"Awakening: Portraits of Life and Death\" features fascinating, unexpected voices from various walks of life, old and young, believers and unbelievers, dying and healthy, well-known and obscure. For them death is no longer an abstraction. Whether through a dire prognosis, the imminence of their own death, the loss of a loved one, a sudden epiphany, or a temperament born to question, these are people who have truly 'awakened' to their mortality. The film is meant to raise ultimate questions, not to provide answers. How could it? Death is \"that undiscovered country,\" as Hamlet so famously described it, \"from whose bourn / No traveler returns.\"\n",

            "ID: 47955, TITLE: A Boatload of Wild Irishmen (2010), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: Flaherty was born in America in 1884 but became a prospector in Canada. A keen photographer, he turned to cinema making a study of life in the Artic, Nanook of the North (1921), which is seen, quite rightly, as the first documentary - the first film to create a narrative from everyday reality. Flaherty's method was to craft simple but exquisitely pictorial dramas from daily life -- the struggle for survival, the pleasures of family, rites of passage. But in Nanook and his next film Moana (1925), made in Samoa, he set his story in the immediate past (when igloo-building or painful tattooing still went on), not the less romantic present. Stereotyping and distortion did not disturb him. The impulse to the romantic even fixed how he saw Industrial Britain (1931). And when he got to Ireland he was no more willing to grasp underlying social realities. In Man of Aran, he made the islanders, for example, hunt basking shark which they had not done for a generation. He couldn't escape the plight of American farmers, though; so in The Land (1942) he fails to tell a story at all. But, finally, he finds his form again in Louisiana Story (1948), a film about oil drilling which ignores the rigs in favour of picturing a lad's idyllic life paddling in the Everglades. A Boatload of Wild Irishmen makes clear these contradictions. Flaherty showed how compelling documentaries could be made but, in his work, it was often at the cost of the truth. The actor (and Aran Islander) Macdara √ì F√°tharta narrates. The script was written by Brian Winston, an Emmy award-winning documentary script-writer and a leading expert on the documentary film. The documentary was directed and produced by Mac Dara √ì Curraidh√≠n. Contributors include Richard Leacock - cameraman on Louisiana Story and father of the contemporary hand-held documentary style, Martha Flaherty - Flaherty's Inuit granddaughter, George Stoney - documentary filmmaker and professor at New York University, Se√°n Crosson - film scholar at the Huston School of Film, Jay Ruby - anthropologist and film scholar at Temple University, and Deirdre N√≠ Chonghaile - musician and folklorist from √Årainn.\n",

Of the time when the people searched for a new idea for their country? Or from the Maidanrevolution that seemed to divide the country into two camps? Or is it more the long echo of Soviet thinking in Dobropolje and representative for the entire eastern Ukraine that led to the bloody conflict? The film portrays the place Dobropolje, in the east Ukraine - 70 km from the separatist border away- and some of it's people. The protagonists are inventive and grasping: they redirect a single club, build a zoo with chameleons that must be smuggled over the new border. They play in a heavy metal band and drive taxi. The film shows a region that not only in Europe kept playing on our minds for many months. It shows people on the periphery of the war, how it changed their daily lives and how people react on their new and old needs. Their struggle for survival is sometimes not without quirky moments that give the film an unexpected lightness. The two directors Veronika Glasunowa and Lukasz Lakomy have begun long before the war started with the preparations for the film. This enabled them to build a relationship of trust that even in wartime had stock and has helped to get extraordinary insights.\n",

Combining stylish cinematography with content both humorous and moving, this fast-paced documentary traces his rise from seemingly hopeless beginnings to international celebrity and stardom in the West, as it follows the preparations for his first show at London Fashion Week, inspired by the erotic paintings of major British artist Allen Jones. Arkadius Weremczuk was born in Parczew, Poland, to strict parents who rejected his unorthodox longings for art and beauty. He was forced to study pedagogy, but finally rebelled, desperate to follow his dreams. He sold his few belongings to buy a one-way ticket to Italy, where he found work as a dishwasher in a beach hotel, working 80-hour weeks and sketching designs after midnight on kitchen napkins. At last he saved the money to buy a ticket to London, and gained acceptance to the prestigious St Martin's College. Supporting himself by sewing at night, he finally graduated top of his class, gained prestigious sponsorship from Swiss watch company Ebel, and acquired a clientele of British aristocrats and international catwalk fame for his outrageous original creations. WILD ORCHID DREAMS reveals Arkadius's roots in Parczew - his family recall how he was branded a weirdo in the town, and bullied for his crazy ideas. In Italy, the owners of the Alle Dune Hotel praise his hard work as a dishwasher. In striking contrast, we see Arkadius preparing the exotic creations for his first international catwalk show - selecting models, choosing make-up and luxury fabrics, and finally, starring dramatically in the show itself! He discusses art, seeing himself more as an artist than simply as a fashion designer, and arguing heatedly with his creative assistants about pricing and value. Interviews with British aristocrat and socialite Olga Polizzi, with the CEO of Ebel watches Sandro Arabian, and with his top London PR firm underline the contrast between the world he has left behind and the reality of his glittering future. Stunning footage of the clothes - ranging from the charming, to the sculptural, to the startlingly erotic - provides visual highlights to the narrative.\n",

In Euripides' play The Phoenician Women, Jocasta stays alive a little bit longer to try and reconcile her sons Eteokles and Polyneikes but stabs herself after they kill each other. But in Kermani's Jocasta, Jocasta does not kill herself. She survives after her sons' mutual murders to perform a ritual sacrifice to save Thebes, and to satiate Ares' ancient fury of Kadmos' slaying of the dragon. Jocasta chooses the creative act of writing over the act of suicide. Her ritual act re-members that Body is Presence and that the origins of writing are sacred manifestations of Being. She reverses the taboo, and reestablishes the symbolic. Jocasta takes its genesis from an ancient Greek play, but it displays a contemporary condition of exile and communicates how ancient wars resonate for modern America. Jocasta reflects a historical mirror on the tenuous present in which we are living.\n",

One of the reasons she is accepted is that mother of the family is absolutely overburdened by the household, so she stays despite the resistance of the father, normally - an indisputable authority in the family. She develops a special bond with the youngest of the boys, four-year old Simcha, so far incapable of speaking. She teaches him while walking in the park, and it seems that during the upcoming Passover Seder, Simcha will be able to chant parts of the Haggadah.

            "ID: 48514, TITLE: Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room (2005), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: Enron dives from the seventh largest US company to bankruptcy in less than a year in this tale told chronologically. The emphasis is on human drama, from suicide to 20,000 people sacked: the personalities of Ken Lay (with Falwellesque rectitude), Jeff Skilling (he of big ideas), Lou Pai (gone with $250 M), and Andy Fastow (the dark prince) dominate. Along the way, we watch Enron game California's deregulated electricity market, get a free pass from Arthur Andersen (which okays the dubious mark-to-market accounting), use greed to manipulate banks and brokerages (Merrill Lynch fires the analyst who questions Enron's rise), and hear from both Presidents Bush what great guys these are. The fortunes of Houston-based Enron Corporation, which went from having $65 billion in assets to going bankrupt in less than a month, are chronicled. The stories generally focus on the people who built what was a house of cards called Enron, knowing what they were doing was mostly smoke and mirrors, often illegal, and often at the expense of the working class, but still proceeded out of pride, arrogance and/or greed. The film focuses primarily on the two at the top who were responsible for setting the corporate culture for all those under them: Chair and CEO 'Kenneth Lay (I)' (qv) and COO 'Jeff Skilling' (qv). While many of the top executive were able to liquidate the majority of their shares from the company before the plunge, the general investor and the employees, who sunk much if not all of their 401s into the company, were the ones who ultimately got burned, let alone those, such as California utility users and payers, who were negatively affected along the way. The film also details others who were complicit to the goings-on at Enron, such as the banks and Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, for whatever multitude of possible reasons from greed to ignorance to not wanting to cross the all powerful Enron. While the outcomes for such major players within Enron as Cliff Baxter, 'Andrew Fastow' (qv) and 'Lou L. Pai' (qv) are known, the legal fates of Lay and Skilling are still in front of the courts at the time of the production of this film. The story of Enron, the energy company, and its rise and inglorious fall. We see its origins in the 1980s, how it was set up with energy deregulation in mind, and how it profited off the deregulation. Moreover, we see how it took accounting practices to the extremes, to the point that the senior executives were cooking the books. There is also coverage of the unethical practices of Enron' traders, particularly in the California electricity market. In the end it all comes crashing down, losing everyday, law-abiding employees their jobs, savings and pensions.\n",

            "ID: 48532, TITLE: Mit mir (2000), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: A woman is lying on a bed. Her double is stretched out next to her, and she slowly turns to caress it, to kiss and lick it before the two cuddle up to each other and the scene darkens. A straightforward etude. A simple setup, though with a false bottom: The woman is played by the filmmaker, who has cloned her ghostly actors by means of multiple exposures. With Me, shot in 16mm and silent, resembles early cinematic works and their phantoms, and not only because of this special effect. Taken together, the old-fashioned interior and the faded colors, the jerky movements, the slightly exaggerated gestures and the almost transparent bodies create a somewhat eerie and somnambulistic atmosphere. And the doppel√§nger motif, which is closely linked to supernatural experiences, also contributes to this feel. At the same time, these images also possess a sense of absence. The overlapping time periods on the strip of film, a result of the production method, literally show through. The space is a fixed quantity and therefore has a dual presence. The action leaves fleeting traces, like a daydream in which the familiar secretly returns. (Isabella Reicher)\n",

After that, when you're 21, you return to your normal life, leaving it all behind, and you erase your memory of those three years. And then you begin your life. But not so fast... In a country under constant threat, your duty doesn't end there; it continues with the mandatory Reserves Service. In March 2002 a war started, and I was drafted to the reserve forces. I was greeted into Alpha Company, where I found myself a soldier once again. We left our lives behind, riding on the dusty roads into the inferno. I took my camera with me, and it never left my side for 5 years. In one hand was the M-16, the LAU on my back, and with the other hand, holding on as if my life depended on it, was my Sony DVCam, shooting footage of everything I could. This movie is the story of the people in Alpha Company, whom every year dress and become soldiers. Under the guise of our olive green uniform and lethal weapons, we're asked to do some of the toughest, most unsettling tasks, in the heart of an urban Palestinian town. This is our contribution to our country, our democracy, it's a tax we pay for Israel, to be like any other western culture where people can sit at home and watch TV, like in Europe, or like in far away America. This is the story of the burden, the guilt and the sorrow we have to carry with us. It's the story of the ways we make ourselves forget what we must do every year for 30 days. Forget, and then return to it again. The camera followed us from the moment we dressed in our uniform to the moment we put our casual clothes - our civilian uniform - back on. The camera was with us in the most difficult and dangerous moments, and stayed there when we laughed and entertained ourselves behind the shielded walls of the barracks. Pornography, drugs and alcohol were often our window to the other way of life, when it got hard and unbearable, when we thought we were going to loose it. Attention Alpha Company! is the surreal story of the civilian-soldier, and the inhuman task he carries upon himself, when everybody else wants to forget. This movie is a view into the looking glass, to remind us what is happening in our own back yard, lest we forget.\n",

Crane probes the track record of those who openly crave the introduction of a One World hierarchical government. Exposing the agenda of those who have presided over events leading directly to the launching of illegal wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and who continually demonstrate their desire to perpetuate a state of permanent global conflict; whilst systematically eroding personal freedom, through the process of gradualism. So what does all this have to do with organic farming and natural health? Part of the New World Order agenda is to remove the requirement for food labeling and to restrict and ultimately prohibit the sale of all natural health products. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg; behind the Codex Alimentarius Commission are the United Nations and the World Health Organization, working in conjunction with the multinational pharmaceutical cartel and international banks. It is now a criminal offense in parts of Europe to sell herbs as foods. An agreement called EEC6565 equates selling herbs as foods to selling other illegal drugs. Action is being taken to accelerate bringing other European countries into \"harmonization.\" Yet Ian's message is not all doom and gloom, concluding that the unfolding events present us with significant opportunity for true political alchemy. An ex-oilfield executive, Ian R. Crane now lectures and writes on the geo-political webs that are being spun; with particular focus on US Hegemony and the NWO agenda for control of global resources.

            "ID: 48830, TITLE: The Last Old Master (????), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: The story of Ralph Wolfe Cowan (RW) is a kind of rags-to-riches of epic, fable-like proportion. A classic American tale of pursuing your dreams to wherever they take you and constantly rising to the challenges they present. Raised in a modest home, in small town America, during WWII, RW demonstrated a talent, focus, passion and charisma that propelled him to a life beyond his wildest imaginings. RW was a true child prodigy. A paratrooper in the US Army. Has battled his personal demons and come out on top, with an incredible spiritual outlook on life. He's traveled the globe many times with little more than a backpack and a paintbrush only to find himself the royal guest at palaces from The United Arab Emirates to Monaco. He's painted more reigning monarchs - Kings, Queens, Presidents, Sultans, Popes - than any other painter in history. Not to mention an incredible list of movie stars and celebrities - Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jackson, Liz Taylor - and many other fascinating people, though somehow the world does not yet know his name. He's been declared the greatest portrait painter by Edmund Warren Perry at The Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. And is a lovely, funny, and generous man. His story has as much historical significance as artistic beauty. His knowledge, experience and perspective on art (painting in particular) is a buried treasure that will leave a hole in human history if not sorted through and shared. After suffering a debilitating stroke in 2013 RW has re-taught himself to paint and is currently, at the age of 82, doing the best work of his life. His story tells itself in such a fascinating, funny, and touching way, that it's impossible to stop watching. Through interviews with RW, his close friends, as well as many of those he's painted we learn about the extraordinary life that he's lived and the incredible lives he's touched through not only his art, but his spirit. Spanning the lobbies of hotels he couldn't afford a room in as a teenage art student looking for commissions in 1940's NYC, to the Miami heyday of the 50's, to the grand Las Vegas casinos of the 60's, to the golden age of the Lexington thoroughbred horse farms in the 70's, to the Royal Palaces of the world and everywhere in between, the one thing connecting folks like Donald Trump and Kenny Rodgers with Las Vegas gangsters of a forgotten era, to Elvis Presley, Imelda Marcos, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Princess Grace and the Sultan of Brunei, is Ralph Wolfe Cowan. Beyond the interviews, we take a look inside his studio where he paints every day, his home life, and have the wonderful opportunity to travel with him to deliver portraits, land new commissions and visit old friends, including Johnny Mathis, one of RW's oldest and dearest. Every step of the way, we are as immersed in his story as we know our audiences will be when they experience The Last Old Master.\n",

            "ID: 48849, TITLE: Only New Orleans (2015), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the coast off New Orleans with horrific force. It was the worst natural catastrophe in recent American history, with over 1,800 casualties and one million people displaced in the region. This film recalls those dramatic events, shows interviews with survivors and gives us a feel for how this extraordinary city and its people continue to find the inspiration to push on, buoyed to an unrivaled extent by the power of music. 'Only in New Orleans' is something you hear often in the city, particularly as a defiant jab at certain conservative politicians who 10 years ago would have just as easily left the whole place under water forever. Yet the city forms the roots, to a significant degree in some cases, of musical genres from jazz, R&B, and rock 'n' roll to soul, funk, reggae and hip-hop. Musicians including Allen Toussaint, Irma Thomas, James Andrews, Ivan Neville, Davis Rogan, Jon Cleary, Big Freedia and Travis \"Trumpet Black\" Hill as well as employees from the city's emergency task forces tell their stories of the power of music and of the destruction of Katrina. ONLY NEW ORLEANS is an evocative story of disaster and of the abilities of people to keep on living in the aftermath, and in the case of New Orleans, to do so by harnessing the inimitable force of music and celebrating life in the face of death. \"Trumpet Black\" represents a special instance of this strength of spirit. An up-and-coming star on the music scene in New Orleans, Travis became ill and died while on tour overseas. His tragic fate became an essential element of the film while the city celebrated the young star's passing for over two weeks with funeral processions that transformed into rollicking parties - and all of this in a city whose defiant and creative population has managed to reinvent itself in the 10 short years since its greatest disaster.\n",

When he returns to Toronto, he finds that his love and compassion are desperately needed in his own circle of friends. The film tracks us throughout the summer of 2011 as his attempts to enrich the lives and relationships of young people struggling through bullying, racism, emotional, physical and sexual abuse. As he breaks down barriers of intolerance and bigotry, the people his actions affect find inspiration in him. Through his heartfelt, up-beat, catchy, and positive music, he is eventually able to bring both conflicted sides together.

Albert seemingly loves the traveling circus life, which was the reason he abandoned his first wife, Agda, and their then two infant sons, as she hated that life. However Albert laments not making any money - unlike what he believes his American counterparts are doing - an issue both in paying his employees and keeping the circus afloat. Albert is now married to Anne, the bareback rider of the circus. The next stop for the Alberti Circus is the town where Agda lives. Albert plans on visiting her and their now two adolescent sons, the three who he hasn't seen in three years. This visit is against Anne's wishes, she who believes he only wants to see Agda to return to his old family while abandoning Anne and the circus. Because of what she believes Albert is going to do, Anne takes action in the only way she knows how, which involves Sjuberg's traveling theater troupe currently in the same town, and from which Albert borrowed costumes. Their stop shows both Albert and Anne how they feel about their current lot in life. On a gray morning, a circus caravan arrives in the town where Albert the ringmaster's family lives. He hasn't seen them for three years and has taken a mistress, the young and buxom Anne. Albert calls on his wife; Anne, jealous and wanting out, visits a theatrical troupe and lets an actor, Frans, seduce her in exchange for a necklace he says is valuable. Anne finds out it's worthless at about the same time Albert's wife declines to let him live with the family. Albert and Anne are stuck with the circus and each other; there's a show tonight, Frans will be there smirking and sardonic, the bear is mangy, the clown is as sour as they come, and suicide offers an exit.\n",

            "ID: 49021, TITLE: Behind That Curtain (1929), GENRE: mystery, DESCRIPTION: Sir George hires Hillary Gatt to find out more about Eric who wants to marry Lois. Gatt is murdered and the couple, married, run off to India. Old friend John Beetham sympathizes with the bride who sees that her hubby is a liar and drunk. John and Lois fly to San Francisco. Eric shows up and tries to kill John, but Scotland Yard's Lt. Charlie Chan intervenes. The story begins as noted with Sir George being assured by Mr. Galt - some sort of private investigator - that he has the evidence to prove that Eric Durand is a thorough cad and rotter unworthy of marrying Sir George's heiress niece Eve - and will bring it to him in the morning. Shortly after, Colonel Beetham and Galt have an argument in Galt's office witnessed by Galt's aide. Late that night, Galt is killed at his office, and a pair of Chinese slippers are placed on the dead man's feet by the murderer, who, when he flees, is observed and followed by the building's night watchman, a low, but cunning Cockney type, who will later blackmail Durand. Next day, Eve and Durand confront Sir George (who favors Beetham as an in-law and helps to finance his exploring expeditions) with the news that they have been married the night before - apparently Durand had saved Eve's life - \"something any man would do.\" Sir George turns his metaphorical back on the couple, and they leave for India for no particular reason. Beetham prepares to leave for the \"deserts of Persia.\" Meanwhile Sir Frederick of the Yard - who speaks more slowly than your average person on the edge of mortality - by the way, British and American accents are parceled out randomly among the characters - has called his friend Chan, the latter having explained that the slippers had been a gift from the emperor of China to Beetham for meritorious service and that their embroidery means, \"Walk lightly, go far.\" This is odd because the film is made and ends in 1929 though it begins several years earlier, Beetham appears to be meant to be in his early thirties, and the last emperor of China (a child) was overthrown in 1912. Anyway, Sir Frederick notes, \"The Chinese - they see things that we don't.\" In India, a year later, the Durands are living quietly, if unhappily for Eve. Her uncle has died, apparently of heartbreak. Her husband sits around drinking whiskey-sodas - \"strong ones\" and having an affair with their servant girl who fans him and sings the same song over and over. Eve serendipitously runs into Beetham in the market - he is leaving for Persia the next day. He swears to take care of her if she should need him. Eve goes home and finds a: one of the singing servant's earrings on her bed and b: a letter from the Cockney porter back in England who has not been receiving his 100 pound stipends and who hints strongly that Durand killed Galt. Eve confronts Durand, who more or less admits things. She says she will not make a scandal or divorce him, but he needs to stay away from her. He tries to break in her bedroom door, and she flees to Beetham and begs him to take her with him so that she can \"totally disappear\" in the dunes of Persia. Beetham reluctantly agrees - there is danger (which we never see) but he loves her. Sir Frederick (of the Yard) has been following these people around the world for the past year. He drops in on Durand (whom he suspects as the man is an obvious bounder) to talk to Eve. Then he, Durand and a Persian official fly a monoplane to Beecham's encampment. They search for Eve, but Sir Frederick (who knows a gentleman when he sees one) makes it clear that he really hasn't tried to find her, though he knows she is there because of Beetham's sketches of her on his maps. Beetham's servant (played by Boris Karloff) leads Durand astray. Sir Frederick enjoins Beetham on his honor to meet with him the next day in Teheran and to bring Eve. (If he is only a day away from Teheran, one wonders what Beetham is exploring.) Anyway, Eve has already fled on horseback, and Beetham's party make no attempt to go after her, though later Beetham will say that he had been searching for several days before he comes to see Sir Frederick. Another year passes. Eve is taking the ferry into San Francisco when she reads that Beetham is to give a lecture that night - she saves the clipping and goes to her job as an elevator operator. Durand comes on the elevator and she stops it between floors. He has already killed the blackmailing cockney and tries to force Eve to give him the incriminating letter or he will kill her too. Under duress she agrees, takes Durand to the fifth floor, pushes him out the door, plummets the elevator to the lobby and flees to her apartment. As she arrives, two Chinese detectives from the San Francisco Police who have ransacked her room and found the letter are leaving. (One of them is said to be Chan.) Eve determines to go to Beetham at his lecture. Sir Frederick has instructed Chan to have the place heavily guarded, but to allow Durand to get in. Eve quietly enters the back of the hall and takes a seat. Beetham sees her, and, instead of delivering his lecture, begins talking about love, much to the mystification of his audience. Durand appears at a side door with a gun and a bad twitch. He attempts to shoot Eve, but Sir Frederick takes the bullet - only a flesh wound. Beetham and Eve explain everything, and the news comes that Durand has been killed resisting arrest, probably because Chan (whom we do not see) thought the world would be better off without Durand. The lovers embrace (off camera), and Sir Frederick takes his leave for the hospital, saying, \"We have walked softly, gone far, and now the journey is ended.\"\n",

            "ID: 49190, TITLE: The Great Man (1956), GENRE: drama, DESCRIPTION: On the death of popular national radio commentator Herb Fuller, underling Joe Harris undertakes to prepare an hour long, eulogistic program featuring interviews with Fuller's friends. But, though Fuller was beloved by 150 million of what all the pros term the \"great unwashed,\" all Harris can find is victims, cynical users, and outright enemies of Fuller. Is this where the magic of editing comes in? Beloved New York based national radio and television talk/variety show host Herb Fuller has just died in a car crash in Hartford, he affectionately referred to as a great man. At the end of the week in three days, the Amalgamated Broadcasting System, the network which airs most of his shows, plans on airing a one hour special in Herb's memory, it an all-star spectacular with celebrities who only knew Herb from being on his shows waxing poetic about him. Ambitious network executive Sid Moore, who discovered Herb at a small New England station but who was largely pushed out of Herb's shows when he became famous, wants to capitalize personally on Herb's death by endorsing Joe Harris, who hosts a New York man-about-town show for the local affiliate, as Herb's replacement, Sid signing Joe to a personal contract in the process. Company president Philip Carleton does assign the job of hosting the memorial show to Joe, Philip who implies that Joe getting Herb's job is largely dependent on how the memorial show turns out. Joe does want Herb's job, as, as a former investigative journalist, he hates his man-about-town gig, which he considers fluff. Not knowing Herb well - despite Sid wanting Joe to pretend they were great friends - and itching to use his investigative skills once again, Joe pitches the idea of making the memorial show instead an intimate portrait of Herb the man by telling the stories about him that the public doesn't know directly by those that did know him, including the talent who appeared on his shows, the regulars, including bandleader Eddie Brand and vocalist Carol Larson, referred to as the \"Fuller Family\". One of the most heart-wrenching of Herb's broadcasts - one which Joe wants to discover the behind the scenes stories - was made on the front lines during the war, where he was personally delivering blood plasma donated by a listener to an injured soldier who would have died without it. But as Joe progresses with his investigation, he finds that Herb was universally disliked by almost all that knew him, and those that did like him did so solely because of what direct benefit Herb was in their life. Joe also finds that much of what was Herb's on-air persona was smoke-and-mirrors, and not who Herb really was a a person. Joe has to decide if he too will resort to smoke-and-mirrors to give the public and the network brass what they want in memorializing Herb, the long term job on the line versus his journalistic morals.\n",

            "ID: 49192, TITLE: Picture (2015), GENRE: music, DESCRIPTION: In early 2010 the Alloy Orchestra was commissioned an original score for percussion ensemble, based on a musical setting drawn on a 3-foot long sheet of squared notebook paper. Its operating principle was a fixed tempo - 60 beats per minute - to be strictly followed by the musicians throughout the piece. Within this grid, the performers were given complete freedom to determine the timbre, the volume and the sequence of themes to be chosen for their work. Two artists - a drummer and a draughtsman - listened to the recording of the music without any knowledge of the instructions provided for its creation. Unbeknownst to each other, both were given the task of playing along with their respective instruments: one with a drum in front of a camera, the other with pen, brushes, ink and colored pigments on 35mm film strips. Neither of them was given time to prepare or rehearse beforehand. The footage was assembled and edited in strict adherence to the criteria adopted for the music. The Alloy Orchestra was then asked to accompany the film with their own score, thus confronting the band with the challenge of interpreting the responses of the drummer and the draughtsman to the recorded piece. This coexistence of extreme discipline and total improvisation is at the core of the project-a generative process where a self-imposed rule is refracted in a potentially infinite set of variations, like in a hall of mirrors.\n",

Mozart's prodigious output and untimely death have helped place him on a pedestal that can often blind us to the unique brilliance of his work in the context of his life and times. Tackling the sentimental tourist industry of Salzburg and the cloying reverence in which Mozart is too often held, Service visits the key cities and rooms in which Mozart lived and worked, plays some of Mozart's original instruments and scores, and gradually uncovers the brilliance and originality of his work as the 18th century turns into the early 19th. There is the prodigious childhood when Mozart was feted as an infant phenomenon around Europe's most glittering courts, and his golden decade in Vienna in which masterpiece followed masterpiece - operas, symphonies, piano concertos, string quartets - as if this short, high-voiced man-child must have been taking dictation from some divine source, until his death at the age of just 35 in 1791.

            "ID: 49364, TITLE: The Writing in the Sand (1991), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: Constructed entirely from black & white photographs, the film evokes the magic of an urban family's day out on the windswept beaches of north East England. It is packed with action, invention and surprise: bodiless heads sticking out of the sand; teenagers jumping in the sea fully clothed; family picnicking under a blanket. Memory and fantasy intermingle with expressions of intoxicating freedom and quizzical encounters with nature. When a forewarning is ignored, a sunny daydream turns unexpectedly into a nightmare. The sea breaks into an awesome display of fury and pain, and a strange metamorphosis takes place on the shore. Whilst celebrating the child in each of us, the film is a timely and powerful reminder of our interdependence with the natural world. Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen began to photograph on the North Eastern coast on her arrival in Newcastle in the late 1960s. Initially attracted to the extraordinary abandon with which the Northern people take to the freedom offered by their beaches, she later focused on the natural elements and transformations of the beaches as live drama in their own right. The resulting book Writing in the Sand, published in 2000, was a culmination of twenty five years of inspired photography. An unprecedented experiment, Amber's film The Writing in the Sand is also a mammoth labour of love by its creative team. The film's 400 photographs, taken by Sirkka-Liisa over 17 years, were shot with free camera movements and married to a complex soundtrack of beach recordings, music and poetry. The result is a stirring cinematic experience.\n",

With unfettered access, Director and Director of Photography David Byars gives a detailed, on-the-ground account of the 2016 standoff between protestors occupying Oregon's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and federal authorities. After the leaders of this occupation put out a call to arms via social media, the Malheur occupiers quickly bolstered their numbers with a stew of right-wing militia, protestors, and onlookers.

NO MAN'S LAND documents the occupation from inception to its dramatic demise and tells the story of those on the inside of this movement - the ideologues, the disenfranchised, and the dangerously quixotic, attempting to uncover what draws Americans to the edge of revolution.\n",

Located where Columbus first set anchor in his 1492 discovery of the New World, the village hosted a singular fishing community, where traits and habits of the Taƒõno indigenous population had survived and mixed with those of the Spanish colonizers.

He's been a surfer for most of that time but has never had a prosthetic leg that was actually intended to be surfed on. Insurance companies are not obligated to pay for anything other than what fulfills \"necessary life functions\". According to them the only \"necessary life function\" is walking. Not running, not riding a bicycle, and definitely not surfing. So his entire surfing life he's been surfing on old walking legs that have been personally frankensteined into makeshift surf legs.

            "ID: 49667, TITLE: The Little Sister (1909), GENRE: short, DESCRIPTION: Every great city has some particular section that stands out clear and distinct from all others because of the peculiar characteristics of its denizens in their daily walks of life. London has her West End, Paris her Latin Quarter and New York her East Side. It is from the latter that material for our silent drama was drawn, and no one is more competent to correctly picture the life and habits of the denizens of the crowded East Side tenement district than Edward W. Townsend, the famous author of \"Chimmie Fadden;\" for he has made an exhaustive study of the underworld where virtue and vice walk hand in hand with poverty and crime. In the opening scene of \"Little Sister\" Mr. Townsend introduces us to what is commonly called the \"sky parlor\" of the tenement district, the roof of a house. Here we see Jew and Gentile, foreigner and native, mingling in a common fellowship, all because of the crying need of that community, want of God's fresh air. We are shown the silent, pathetic figure of a youth who, though naturally good at heart, because of his association and environments is losing the great battle of life. Already he has slipped into the class called, \"suspects\" by the Central Office men. His faculties dwarfed by his constant contact with misery and crime, Dick has ceased to strive for an honest means of livelihood. Embittered by his lot, he regards society as his natural enemy and ekes out his precarious living without the effort of labor, though with the full knowledge that in doing so he is hourly gambling with the price of liberty. All this is unknown to \"Little Sister,\" who dearly loves him and for whom he entertains an affection strikingly at variance with his evil habits. We see her in the small but neat room over which she presides as housekeeper, alternately fondling her doll and preparing a meal in fond anticipation of Dick's return; while at the same time we witness his theft of a pocketbook from an aged member of the group on the tenement roof. The theft traced to Dick through the suspicion that is ever attached to his presence, she refuses to believe his guilt but determines, with a precocity born of hard knocks, to thereafter follow and guard his footsteps lest he succumb to temptation. Along the crowded streets Dick prowls, with ever-shifting eye alert for opportunity to pick a pocket or steal a valuable, the pathetic figure of his little guardian angel, with rag doll clutched tightly in her arms, ever close by. His opportunity comes in front of a theater, but the attempt is clumsy and the watch on which his fingers close for an instant is jostled from his grasp and falls to the sidewalk, where it is recovered. Wandering along the residential portion of Fifth Avenue, an open window attracts his attention. A momentary glance up and down the street and he mounts the iron railing and climbs into the house of wealth, observed by none but \"Little Sister,\" who is crouching in the shadow of a neighboring stoop. Once in the room, he hides behind a screen and waits for a propitious hour to carry out his plans. Chance does not favor him, for the master of the house, while in the act of closing the window, discovers his presence, overpowers him and sends for the police. While awaiting their arrival Mr. St. Clair is astonished to see the window raised and an elfish figure, doll in arms, climb through and gaze enquiringly about. Discovering their presence and realizing what arrest will mean to the brother she loves so dearly, \"Little Sister\" throws herself on her knees and pleads for his release. Struck by her resemblance to his own little girl whom death has taken from him, and moved by the sincerity of her pleading, his captor not only grants her request but gives the youth a fresh start in life, far from the temptations of the city. The story closes with scenes of \"Little Sister\" and her now reformed brother enjoying the simple and wholesome life of the country.\n",

            "ID: 49817, TITLE: Flying Sheilas (2009), GENRE: documentary, DESCRIPTION: 'Flying Sheilas' is an amazing insight into the stories of 8 Australian female military and commercial pilots, depicting their extraordinary flying careers and the visual spectacle of where they were fortunate enough to live and work in Australia and beyond. Their stories are intertwined through the career of Melbourne born pilot, Susan Michaelis, who introduces each of them and how they played a part in her career. The first of the Flying Sheilas, Nancy Bird Walton AO, OBE, is shown learning to fly at Mascot in 1933 with Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. She became the youngest female professional pilot in the British Commonwealth while navigating west of Bourke via the Shell road map and via 'where the fence posts met'! Deborah Lawrie will always be known for her historic legal challenge with Sir Reginald Ansett, through the Equal Opportunities Commission in the late 1970s. - A legal battle to become the first commercial pilot with the major airlines. In the mid 1980s the RAAF selected Robyn Williams to become one of the first two female pilots to join the Australian Air Force. After being a transport pilot she was selected to undertake 'Test Pilots Course'. She later went on to become a Wing Commander accepting the new C130-J Hercules into the Australian Air Force. Around the same time Melissa Blain was a charter pilot flying out of Moorabbin in Melbourne. Forced to fly crayfish as she was advised that clients would not fly with a female pilot, Melissa went onto traverse the country daily whilst flying as a captain for Virgin Blue. Flying up and down the NSW Coast was where Sally Muggeridge started her commercial flying in Australia where she met Susan on the first ever female crewed flight for the Qantas group in 1992. Sally then went to Europe to fly until she decided to swap flying regional jets operating at 450 knots to become an airship 'Blimp' pilot in the USA doing 45 knots with a strong tailwind. Christine Davy, MBE, studied for her commercial pilot licence in 1956 whilst representing Australia at the winter Olympics as a downhill skier. Flying a range of aircraft for Connellan Airways in 1963 out of Alice Springs, Christine became Australia's first multi crew female captain flying DC3s throughout the Outback. The DC3 she states always had 'personality' as no one ever quite knew what it would do next. Christine swapped fixed wing flying in the outback for helicopters based up in the Kimberleys, servicing the offshore oil industry where she met Susan. Susan spent her early flying years up in the Northern Territory Top End and in the Kimberleys, Western Australia. The Flying Sheilas stories are told through the eyes of Susan Michaelis, who learnt to fly at Moorabbin in Victoria in the mid 1980s. Susan, the winner of the CAA Sir Donald Anderson trophy spent her early aviation career flying throughout the Northern Territory Top End and in the Kimberleys, Western Australia then going on to fly in the Qantas Regional network for many years. It is her remarkable story of how the various Flying Sheilas crossed her path and played a part in her life that is central to this unique documentary. The last of the pilots, Robyn May, flew extensively throughout South Australia after spending the early 1970s flying throughout the highlands and coastal regions of Papua New Guinea. A totally unique vision of Australia as seen through the eyes of eight amazing 'Flying Sheilas'.\n",
